# React-App2-Products-in-Cart-
Created a React App for Products in cart also added two buttons (Add &amp; Return) and Texts that change. When we click "Add button" "n times" the text says the product "only "n" items are available" and when we click "Return" it shows according to how much left. Added extra texts that says "offer is on" "Hurry up" "only few left" according to stock.
